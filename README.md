# pi_estimator
Python script which estimates pi using the fact that the odds that two numbers are coprime is equal to six divided by pi squared. The program generates a user-defined number of integers, checks if they are coprime, and uses this count to calculate the odds that two randomly chosen numbers are coprime. After the odds are calculated, it takes the square root of the odds divided by six to calculate pi.
